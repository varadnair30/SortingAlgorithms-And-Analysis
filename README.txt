Data Analysis and Algorithms Project by Varad Nair.
- Prerequisite :- Java Development Toolkit (20.0.2 or above)
-This zip contains 3 files
	1. Project Report
	2. Excel file ( contains graph and input for various algorithms )
	3. Code related files (into DAAProject folder)
- Extract the files

GUI Implementation
------------------
- To run the GUI code, navigate to the folder(DAA Project--> dist--> DAAProject.jar) in which the DAAProject.jar file is located
- Double click 'DAAProject.jar' or type cmd on the explorer. Inside cmd type without quotes "java -jar DAAProject.jar" to run the GUI file of the project
- When you run the jar file, choose Manual or Random entry of data ( in the form of space separated integers into the Array field)
- There is a random function applied in the code and the inputs will be choosen randomly as instructed.
- The program will then ask you to enter the size of array.
- After that the click on 'Display' button and code will automatically display the result(The given array will be displayed in Console window accommodating large inputs )
- The program is capable enough to Run once and use multiple times i.e. you can reset the fields by clicking 'Clear All' 
- Once you are done , simply click on 'Close' button to exit.
- Find the code by following DAA Project--> src--> daaproject--> HomePage.java


CLI/Console Implementation
--------------------------
- To run the CLI code, go to DAA Project--> src--> daaproject--> DAAProject.java
- Type cmd on the explorer. Inside cmd type without quotes "javac DAAProject.java" and run, then type and run "java DAAProject.java" to run the CLI file of the project
- When you run the code, enter the input you want manual entry or random.
- There is a random function applied in the code and the inputs will be choosen randomly as instructed.
- The program will then ask you to enter size of array and input the space separated integers as array (if chosen manual)
- After that the code will automatically display the result on console
